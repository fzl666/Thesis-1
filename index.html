    <p>Taking a year of academic leave in New York City alone grants me plenty of time and freedom but sometimes makes me feeling like I am in an intermediate state.
       <br>
       Then I realized I felt this way because my perception of self that is identified by social status and documentations within constitutions-No occupation, and not legally allowed to work in this country.
       <br>
       The moment my student ID was functional again, I instantly felt like a more 'legitimate' member of society.

        <h1>Numbers</h1>
        <p>In one of my projects, I used numbers to interpret systems around me.<br> For example, the subject, self and starting point is 1. 2 extents 1 and serves as a medium/interval between 1 and 3, and 3 is the external world and the end</p>
        <p>I find clarities while interpreting systems using numbers, and I will countinue using it as an inspirtaion for the following project</p>
